## About
AxTools is a swiss knife in the World of Warcraft. First of all, this is platform for executing plugins (written in C#).
Platform provides access to various actions (moving, scanning for objects/NPCs, interacting with them, etc), but don't use any 'hack' or injections in the process of game, so it is safest solution for players who don't need full-featured bot, but need some... useful tools.

## Plugin examples

### Radar
Displays players/NPCs/objects. User can define the list of objects/NPC he wants to track. Tracked objects/NPC can be auto-interacted.

### Fishing
Simple fishing bot. Supports lures and some achivements.

### Black Market Tracker
Show exact time of each lot.

### LuaConsole
Powerful tool for executing user-defined Lua scripts. For example, user can write a profile for fully automated AH bot, or auto-kill explosive orbs in M+, or whatever.

Another plugins: auto-kicker of casts, auto-pickup flags on battlegrounds, auto-follower and so on! Of course, user can write plugins by yourself.

  - auto-login in WoW client without Battle.Net launcher
