## About
AxTools is a swiss knife in the World of Warcraft. First of all, this is platform for executing plugins (written in C#).
Platform provides access to various actions (moving, scanning for objects/NPCs, interacting with them, etc), but don't use any 'hack' or injections in the process of game, so it is safest solution for players who don't need full-featured bot, but need some... useful tools.

## Plugin examples

### Radar
Displays players/NPCs/objects. User can define the list of objects/NPC he wants to track. Tracked objects/NPC can be auto-interacted.
